"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"Really good and durable.
","i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.

"Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.
","Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality
","Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

",1,boAt Rockerz 255
"Overall good but not that worth
","he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"Review update - Product failed after a few months
","Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"Good sound quality
","Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

"Amazing product. Just go for it.
","Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"Frequent failures.
","The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.

"Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.
","Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

"Average product
","The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation
","Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........
","I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Not a great product but great for price.
","I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Not great sound performance but overall ok
","Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

"Not accepting the charging within two days of purchase
","Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

"It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.
","It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

"Not good for workouts
","The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

","I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

"One of the worst earphone I’ve had
","I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

","Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good.

You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this.

"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.
","I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

","These are of really good built quality(premium quality) except rubber holders and provides smooth sound quality and bass(condition is to use proper ear bud) , happy with the purchase as I used some other brand such as JBL,  skullcandy, house of Marley. It is standing with those brands .The bluetooth gets connected very easily, and u also get a 1 year insurance card for your product which gives an enhancement for trusthappy with the productPros:Good built qualityGood sound & bassEasy connectivityPerfectly fitsGood for our doorCons:I found it some what uneasy while in use (might be because of gripper I never used )*Note examples I gave for JBL and .... are for sound quality that I really consider at this point of price

"Wow..!!!!!
","This is a great product. Comes in a nice box and it fits perfect in ears. The sound quality is also very nice. I tested it with couple of different songs and it is too good. I was waiting to buy it and to my luck it came on sale for 999 which is a steal price!!!!!.... I am super happy with this product... I am not sure if price will be available as the normal sale price i saw was 1900+ which I guess might be little expensive but I got it for the real deal so happy happy. 😇

"Sound quality is not good, over bassed
","I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO.

"Good one but not great !
","Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"Good buy at an affordable price
","I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

"The “Boat” experience !!
","I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

","Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM.

"Setting Your Expectations Right
","At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.

"A budget all-rounder by boAt
","I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

","The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.

"Think twice before buying!!!
","I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

","The pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. But I don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity.

"Conectivity dissapointing, design of earpeace flawed
","Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

"Bass lover here. But gets too bassy
","Issues.Cinnectivity.---------------The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.Sound.I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass.

","Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

"Terrible sound quality.
","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.
",5,boAt Rockerz 255
"Conquers the competition...
","Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

"Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about
"," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

"Realistic Review of these Earphones.
","To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

","After using of 1 months :1. Bass is awesome.2. Battery is also good.3. The design is good but the wire is bit lengthy. It feel a little out of the neck.4. The buttons on it are horrible. Sound buttons are good but the middle can do nothing useful. It will pick up the call but u can't disconnect it from there. Also no music forwarding after two click instead it redial the last dialled no. Shitty Configuration.5. Also after a long use , i usually get a bit of headache. Its quite often.

"Best in budget
","It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

","I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.

The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

Jaqueline was lucky enough to have somebody help her with the twisting part. On other accounts,Sound Clarity - 4/5Noise cancellation - 2/5Gym compatibility(sweat, chaos) - 5/5

","Go for the headphones blindly if you are getting it below 1500. Such a awesome sound quality. Had been using it for almost 6 months and they are awesome I tell you.  Best part it is not like most of the bass earphones who sound is not bearable. Just a con, when connected to two devices, say you are listening to music from computer and suddenly receive a call from phone then the voice is bit shaky.

","It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening.

"Sound quality same as Boat 225 Wired earphones which is amazing
","Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.
",5,boAt Rockerz 255
"Good but not happy
","The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw.

"Great Quality in the given budget
","IF you are bass and Treble lover, these wireless earphones are for you. I bought this for Rs 1499/-. I m using it with an Iphone and i enjoyed the output.Positive part: Great Design, Good output for given budget, Noise cancellation  is good too.Negative Part: I experienced Bluetooth connection disturbances wile exercising, U need to use equalizer settings if u do not love Bass and treble.Overall it is a good product....

"Decent build quality and sound
","The product has decent build quality which makes it durable. However the cable is too long which makes it look a little weird hanging around your ears. Battery drains quickly. Sound is amazing, perhaps the USP of the product. Not good for bike riders as wearing a helmet gives pain in the ears.

"Good not Great
","You can take this as a bluetooth version of boat wired 220/225 headsets.Sound and bass is great but not clear in few situations.Noise cancellation was worst to the core voices of people 10m away from you is clearly captured and irritates you to the core, don't know whether it is a product issue which i received.I missed to notice with in the return duration otherwise would of replaced it.Now i need to reach support team for replacement.

"An outstanding pair of wireless earphones - at a cheap price.
","This product's sound quality is impressive. The tagline speaks for itself - immersive stereo sound is truly what one gets. It charges quickly, and lasts for a long time (5 - 6 hours of use). I also own an Audio Technica M50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. Note that these headphones costed north of ₹9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt.

Initially it worked as expected but after two months of normal use, it's earbuds and hooks went off. Then suddenly its left side earpiece stopped working.

Not that other parties hear the announcement but you don't hear anything from call while the announcement is on.

","1 month - awesome2 month - left earphone stopped working3 month - right earphone stopped workingjust after that.. .refer the pics uploaded.Boat is known for it's durability.

","This one is perfect for workouts... Bluetooth connectivity is super..... But....sound output is not at all good at this price range... I got this for ₹999.

"Value for money deal for sporty earphones
","If you're looking for a sporty wireless earphones with mic, go for it. Highly durable,well suited for workout sessions due to it's moisture wicking feature. I'm in love with the lightweight and comfortablity. Battery life is good (over 6 hours). Sound quality is above average vis-a-vis other Bluetooth earphones in the given price range. Noise cancellation, there's room for improvement.

"not good not bad
","Overall its a good headset.. but it have some major drawbacks.. as a music lover i felt that the bass is good enough but the other things are a bit low. and while playing pubg and using voice chat it automatically reduces the surrounding sounds and i can't hear footsteps and gunshots clearly.. so i think these two are a major problem.

"Worth for 1299rs not more than that
","I got this earphone for 949 RS. It is worth for price. Sound quality is very good and bass is also very much high.

Good quality of earbuds that fits perfect in ear and wont hurt for continuos use.cons1. connectivity is wont last longer tha 2.5 mtrs.2. fits slight loose over ear, if you have small ears like i have.Note:havent checked the water resistivity yet. But as of my routine this earphone is resistive to slight swet

","The earphones are of good quality, was looking for earphones in budget, have tried boult space but these are much better, the bass as per the name is perfect, the vocals are also clear and overall the sound is pretty good compared to 'boult space' in which you hear only bass and no vocals. The only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, For better experience keep the volume at 75%.The ratings are below :-Bass - 4.5/5Vocals - 4.5/5Fit - 5/5Bluetooth range - 4.5/5Battery - 4/5

In half n hour it came down from 50% to 20% and at 20% started saying that the battery is down and within one minute the the headphones got switched off which is extremely poor performance by the battery moreover the only indicator is when the battery is charging that from red colour it turns into blue colour but it does not auto cut off which is why you never know when it is fully charged or not....... Now waiting for after sales services since it has a 1 year warranty will have to see what and how fast is the services after sales...... Will update once any update comes from the manufacturer

","Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product
","This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

"Great Headphones!
","Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

","I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth.

"Must buy if u need Bluetooth n u r audiophile who prefers balance sound
","I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

"A must have For Calling N never have4music
","Ossam looks, sturdy design, light weight. Not recommended For music lovers as sound is too metallic N poor bass (unless You forcefully push it in ur canal N align it at a certain angle which may b painful after prolonged use)  But a must have For calling. Connects 2 devices at a timeHowever after a few weeks use, I found That battery indicator is total waste. It may Show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% N then Keep steady at 55% N suddenly 0.

"Best in its segment!
","I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

"JBL T205BT Complete Review
","I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"Not an Ergonomic Design. Not easy to Use!
","Even though, the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good, for couple of Ergonomic reasons, I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller.

"Don't Buy This Product 🙅
","I'm not happy with this product. If you've use JBL earphones before, you won't get feel like JBL from this product. I've purchased this product in ""Rs 2399""💰 but made quality is not like the price. And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones. If you're reading this don't buy this product, go for another one otherwise order from JBL OFFICIAL SITE, you'll get low price also.

"Poor Sound quality
","I used it with OnePlus 6. The sound quality is very poor. There is no way you can increase the sound output.The built is okay. Earphones fit nicely in the ear.Also there is issue of music not playing after a call in between.Overall suggestions don't buy it. No point in purchasing when you can't hear music.
",2,JBL T205BT
"Lives up to the name
","My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

"Good headset if you don't mind what I've stated below
","I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile
",3,JBL T205BT
"Good sound quality with compromise in features
","Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.
",3,JBL T205BT
"Before you buy this please have a look at my review.
","First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

Most of the sound goes out of my ears!The description said its metal earphones, but somehow it feels plastic, so I Don't want to fondle with it too much.Customer care said I could buy some ear clips so that they stay on my ears but I'm not able to find a correct match for it.

"Poor quality and only for listening YouTube videos.
","1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

"Regular music lovers this earphone rocks
","I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"Full indepth review of jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone.
","Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

","One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

"Average earphones.
","Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

","I am writing this review after 1 month of rigorous usage.At first I was confused whether to buy this or not. But it is worth every penny guys. Don't think twice just go for it.The earbuds are the main soul of these earphones. There are people like me out there who don't like the insulated one earbuds. This is the perfect earphones for them.Sound Quality: 9/10Mic: 8/10Battery: 7/10 (Could have been better)Noise cancelation: 5/10 (Reason being the non-earbuds earphones)Build Quality: 7/10Overall rating: 8Worth every penny

"Counterfeit product. Don't buy it.
","I received it yesterday. But I was amazed to see the poor quality of packing done to these earphones.1. Wrapped inside a cheap polycover with some Chinese symbols printed over it.2. It was tape sealed instead of air lock.3. The seal of box was not holographic. Just a piece of tape cut from tape machine.4. Quality of material used for making body of earphones is quiet cheap.I'm don't have second thoughts to, that these earphones are not genuine JBL. They are duplicate.Kindly don't buy. You can't even get refund. They are non refundable.

"Good enough ear pods at a great price
","Pros:1. Good effective bass2. Light weight and good ear fit while walking although not in-ear. For gym and running one has to check the fit3.Noise cancellation just right enough.Cons:1.Blue tooth connectivity is barely 6 m. Does not work if one walks to the next room.

"Good to Buy
","Review after 2 weeks of usage.Built quality is Good but not great.Earbuds design gives nice firm Fit in ear and is comfortable for prolonged use.  Not ideal for Sports, Running or Workout.Sound quality is great with good bass. Could have been better though. With WhatsApp, Skype (60Mbps internet) calling voice volume level is good but with same level on Phone call other party complained it being low.Battery holds charge for good enough time 5hrs. Charging time was around 1.5 to 2hrs.Signal coverage is not that great . Sound turns Robotic when you move to different room or so.  Good for distance 10-12ftOverall serves the purpose.

","After using 20 days am writing the review .If you are comfortable with these type of headset you can enjoy . Usually i prefere these kind of headset since it's very comfortable for me . You can enjoy the good quality of music with bass and call quality is very good . You can't feel any pain in ear if you using for long time also and it's really fits perfectly and you will thought some times you are not wearing it .Overall worth to buy , i bought it on offer .

"Value for money
","One of those good bluetooth earphones in the market. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and the sound output is excellent.Perfect bass, no noise while listening to music with high volume. No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210, but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

Within 5 months rubber covering of right earbud removed autimatically ( glue issue ) when I check the same for left, its also having adhesion issue. I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only. This is not earbud type hence I cannot have a replacement other than throw my headset. Thankyou JBL for selling a non durable product.

"Good Product Would Recommend
","This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"Not suitable for running. Poor sound
","Can't believe this is a JBL product. Not suitable for running due to the charging port and volume blocks being heavy causing the wire to bounce around while running and eventually pull the earphones off. Terrible!!Sound quality is also very average.Boat, Phillips are definitely better. Spent a lot of money on this and now no return option.

"OK OK Product #WORST MIC
","Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation. Overall it is OK, except the mic and noise cancellation.Noise installation: 5 🌟Noise cancellation: -5 🌟Mic : -1 🌟Sound : 4 🌟Bass: 4 🌟Battery🔋: 4🌟Build quality: 2.5🌟Charge time: 4 🌟

"Not working on imo/viber/messenger calls
","Recently i bought JBL Tune205 BT. The quality of the sound is great and comfortable to use for long usage. The earbuds are same as iPhone earphones. The reason for 3 stars is because it doesn't work with imo/viber/messenger voice calls. During the voice calls on these apps the sound comes through mobile speaker not the Bluetooth earphones, but on regular mobile calls it works perfectly fine.

"Good Purchase

"All that glitters... you know the rest!
","For being priced at INR 2,199 (that is how much I got it at) it clearly lacks the JBL standard. I haven't yet tested the battery life or noise cancellation but I'm not concerned about them tbh. It's the sound which prompted me to buy these earpods and I'm very disappointed with the sound quality and had they been offered at even half the price I got it at, it still wouldn't have been a good deal.

"Noise cancellation is poor. Worst customer support!!
","First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL, in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010

"Good base,worst connectivity and battery life.
","One of the worst in so far I've used. Disconnects automatically. To connect it back I've to off and on sometimes. Totally disappointed.base is just enough. Battery life isn't that great to 3.5-4hrs on max usage. Can't use it for commute purposes. Maybe just gym or jogging. Little heavy on the weight side. So they'll drop pretty easily. Need to take care of that too. Totally dissatisfied. Returned the product. 🙏🏻

","Sound quality is excellent, along with the noise cancellation, battery haven't drained since the time I've bought it (I'm not a regular user) but still it's great. Looks good, only problem I faced was fitting it into my ears as the ear piece is too wide (this is the problem I faced with almost all earphones). But the sound quality overcomes and makes your forget about it. I would definitely recommend it.

"Alternative to Apple Airpods
","I have been using Apple Airpods for 3 years now but after replacing multiple Airpods due to it get broke after using while.  I am a big fan of the sound quality offered by Apple it was very difficult to find a good alternative due to which I replaced over 10 headphones by big brand names. I must admit that JBL tried best to make it perfect choice Apple fans however the sound quality is not that great as my previous headset by Apple

"good but not good
","The product is very good for listening long hours of playback,  you won't even feel that you got your earphones. The sound is good too. The fit is excellent as it has earpods fits. The only major issue is that it's not for call(even the feature is there but the quality is bad) the earphone get disconnect automatically sometimes from Bluetooth and the left earpiece stopped working after 2 months usage(i got it replaced, which btw took 25days). See I myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz I can't survive the same city without it. I keep on listening to music for hours and hours. So if you are like me better raise your budget and buy bullet wireless.

"Good sound clarity and output

"Worked great for 10 days. Then totally DIED.
","For a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely NOT made for the gym. The built quality is tacky, plasticky. Earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. There's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. Worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. The bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless.

"These surprised me!
","I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

"Just great!
","I don't understand why people are saying sound so low. Sound is just great. I bet you can't listen to music on full volume. Bass is good. Bt range is 15 feet . But price is high on Amazon. I got mine just for 2199 from jbl store.

"Great for Music -- Not for calls
","I purchased 2 sets of this product and been using for 1 week.Pros:Earpod style, fits nicely, no pain even after using for hours. (This is the main reason I bought)Good sound quality and BassNice build quality and looks great.Cons:No Sir/Google Now-- Very Disappointing, If I knew this, I wouldn't have bought it. I thought every earphone will have a long press google now support. Feels useless while riding bike and while walking.Very low call volume -- This is serious issue while in traffic riding bike in India.Low battery life.Not sweat proof.Poor quality audio in Skype for Business. (App shows your device is causing low call quality)
",3,JBL T205BT
"Overrated
","I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.
",2,JBL T205BT
"Sound, bass
","I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.
",4,JBL T205BT
"Good product to go with Bluetooth
","Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.
",5,JBL T205BT
"Go for it if you are not into plug in ear buds !
","Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.
",4,JBL T205BT
"Not worth the price!
","I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D
",2,JBL T205BT
"Sound quality is great but it may not be that durable.
","Before I write my review, I’d like to make clear that I DIDN’T purchase the item from the Amazon store. Regardless, I wish to write the review as I did come across one problem and would like others to consider it.I’ve had the earphones for almost about a month. I use it on a daily basis. And after first few weeks I noticed the ear-thing coming out. And I didn’t give much attention then but now it’s fully out and it’s bothersome.
",3,JBL T205BT
"A quality product with amazing features
","Bought it a few days ago and really satisfied with its performance!! I would like to highlight its features that make these JBL T205 BT earphones one of its kind...Sound quality = 10/10Bluetooth connectivity=10/10Battery life= 10/10Bass quality= 9.5/10Noise cancellation=9/10Overall a great product and very comfortable to use!!

"Worth it
","You dont realize how much you need wireless earphones unless you have them. Its not necessary but once used going back to wired may seem stupid.......the build and quality are nice ....noise cancellation is not great but its okay......range is not great but fine if you are using in the same room
